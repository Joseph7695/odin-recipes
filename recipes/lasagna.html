    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pineapple has no place on pizza, according to the president of Iceland in an off-the-cuff remark that's gone
        viral on social media. Iceland Magazine first reported on Pineapple Pizzagate following Guðni Th. Jóhannesson's
        appearance at a high school in Northern Iceland. Students grilled him on his pizza topping preference and he
        said he was fundamentally opposed to putting pineapple on top of a pizza. Then he went one step further,
        announcing that he would pass a ban on pineapple as a pizza topping if he had the power to pass laws on his own.
