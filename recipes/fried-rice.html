    <h1>FRIED RICE</h1>
    <img src="../images/friedrice.jpg" alt="Fried Rice">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Chinese-inspired fried rice recipe is my absolute fave. It’s quick and easy to make, customizable with any
        of your favorite mix-ins, and so irresistibly delicious.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooked, chilled rice: Any kind of white or brown rice will do. Just be sure that it is cooked (I always cook
            mine in this rice cooker, which works like a charm) and thoroughly chilled (in a sealed container in the
            refrigerator) before adding it to your hot skillet. Again, freshly-cooked rice will not work well in this
            recipe.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Which add great flavor, texture and protein.</li>
        <li>Carrots, onions, green onions and peas: This is the base mix of veggies that I always use for fried rice,
            but feel free to add in other stir-fry veggies you love (see ideas below).</li>
        <li>Garlic: Freshly-minced.</li>
        <li>Soy sauce: I created this recipe using low-sodium soy sauce. So add less if you’re using traditional soy
            sauce.</li>
        <li>Oyster sauce: This is a major flavor booster in fried rice and (don’t worry) doesn’t taste like oysters. You
            can find it in the Asian section of grocery stores, or order it on Amazon. </li>
        <li>Toasted sesame oil: The finishing touch in this recipe, which is a must. You can also find it in the Asian
            section of grocery stores, or order it on Amazon.</li>
        <li>Butter: My favorite way to stir fry rice.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Scramble eggs: Using a small pat of butter, scramble some eggs in a large sauté pan, breaking them into
            small pieces as you go. Then transfer the eggs to a separate plate, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Sauté veggies and garlic: Return your sauté pan to the heat, and sauté the onions, carrots, peas and garlic
            until soft and cooked through.</li>
        <ku>Stir fry rice: Then turn the burner to high heat. Scooch the veggies over to one side of the pan, melt the
            remaining butter in the other half, and add the chilled rice, soy sauce, and oyster sauce (if using). Then
            stir to combine with the veggies and continue sautéing the rice, stirring every 15-20 seconds or so for 3
            minutes, or until you notice the rice and veggies starting to brown slightly.</ku>
        <li>Remove pan from heat. And stir in your green onions, sesame oil, and scrambled eggs.</li>
        <li>Taste and season. Give the rice a taste, and season with salt and pepper, plus any extra soy sauce or sesame
            oil if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve! Then dish it up and serve nice and warm!</li>
    </ol>
