About the project:
This is part of the practical exercises from The Odin Project. https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes. Thanks to the community for the resource

Before the project:
I'm have a bit of experience on the frontend side when I work as a web developer that is more towards backend role. I would say that I possess the knowledge covered in the exercise, let's see if I could live to my expectations.

Thoughts:
    Project: Recipes
    - Using images locally instead of public images in case the source is lost, in production environments I learnt that you should be using Content Delivery Networks (CDN) together with your own source to deliver the images. 
    - Used the multiple cursor functionality in Visual Studio Code to wrap the copy pasted recipe steps / ingredients with <li> tags
